            <h4>Studying and Improving Motion Indeterminacy Diffusion for Stochastic Trajectory Prediction</h4>
        </a>
        <p class="subtitle">🗓️ September 2022 - February 2023<br />🏁 Finished<br />👥 Enrico Buratto</p>
        <p>Human trajectory prediction is a fast growing subject in the Computer Vision field; the study of this problem
            is acquiring more and more importance due to its practical implications, among which autonomous driving and
            crowd surveillance are the most cited. Many different points of view are being analyzed in order to improve
            the precision and the correctness of the models; for instance, different data can be exploited to better
            understand how humans behave, and different mathematical frameworks can be used to improve the predictions.
            One big acknowledgment in the field is that this is a challenging task due to the inherent indeterminacy
            human motion brings: free will and unpredictability are, in fact, intrinsic to human behavior. The authors
            of the paper on which this work is based try to solve this very issue: their idea, based on the concept of
            diffusion models, is to simulate this indeterminacy by applying random noise and subsequently try to learn
            how to remove it from the available data in order to obtain the most probable trajectories. Their work,
            however, is based on an outdated version of diffusion models; many advancements have been made in the
            meantime, thus the idea for this work: we try to modify the model by applying the improvements, and thus try
            to improve its performance. In addition to this, we tried to expand the model by implementing a goal module,
            already developed and currently in improvement by the VIMP group at University of Padua, in order to include
            additional information and, therefore, to enhance the model capabilities. ​</p>

        <p class="subtitle">🗓️ April 2022<br />🏁 Finished<br />👥 Enrico Buratto</p>
        <p>Interactive Data Visualization course's project at University of Helsinki. The idea of the project is to
            study the global trends in energy consumption and electricity generations between 1900 and 2019. In order to
            study these trends, different visualizations had to be implemented, the most important of them being the map
            visualizations. The final scopes are then to offer an interactive way to access data for each country and
            each year offering useful tools like filters, to offer a static (though still interactive) way to visualize
            the general trends through the years, and to have information quickly available for the user. The project is
            entirely developed using Tableu, one of the most popular data visualization tools.</p>

        <p>
            Machine Learning course's project at University of Hesinki. In short, New Particle Formation (NPF) is the
            phenomenon of a big particle of pollution forming from other small particles under some conditions; this
            event is conditioned by many parameters, which are collected on a daily basis from the Hyytiälä Forestry
            Field Station. These are in turn taken into consideration by us in order to achieve the final goal of the
            project, which is the one of predicting the NPF phenomenon in terms of when it will happen and its entity.
            In order to achieve this goal, we implemented two different machine learning models, one that inferes the
            event/nonevent prediction and one that inferes the intensity of the event, thus labeling it as
            Ia/Ib/II/nonevent.

            Deep Learning course's project at University of Helsinki. The goal of the project is to implement a Neural
            Network capable of recognizing several objects inside an image. Since a picture can have more than one
            label, this problem is different from a simple multi-classification task: it is, indeed, a multi-label and
            mutli-classification jobs. As demostrated by the literature, Convolutional Neural Networks represent the
            goal standard for this kind of tasks; therefore, out entire approach is based on them.

            directors and investors to play around with movie data with the goal of picking the best combination of
            actors, directors, and genres to build the highest-performing imaginary movie they can come up with. The
            performance is based on an estimated box office score model built from existing movie box office numbers and
            IMDb ratings. The final goal is to give movie directors a general direction on which movie can be a good
            investment of time and money and which not using a simple and fast-forward web application.</p>

                Sciacco</a></p>
        <p>In the last decade, the raise of smart assistant devices played a key role for the everyday life as they help
            to retrieve information from the web, manage other home devices and execute routines independently. Even
            though the vocal interaction is getting more and more efficient, not always the commands are interpreted
            correctly. Moreover, looking at deaf people and/or people with speech disabilities, the effective
            interaction is drastically reduced, thus limiting the use of this kind of devices. The main goal of this
            project is to use the visible body parts of a person to interact with smart devices like Google Home through
            human pose estimation and gesture recognition. During our work we compared two different solutions – Google
            MediaPipe and NiTE2 middleware for Kinect –, and for both of these use-cases we tried different
            classification algorithms: multinomial logistic regression, ridge regression, random forest, support vector
            machines and multilayer perceptron. Through intensive trial and error experiments we were able to get
            F1-scores in a range between 0.71 and 0.97 for the different use-cases and classification algorithms, with
            an average accuracy never below 0.70.</p>

        <p>
            This project, which I just started to work on as a side project for fun, aims to build a smart home
            assistant (e.g. Google Home, Amazon Alexa, etc.) using a large language model (e.g. GPT-3, GPT-J, etc.) and
            a Raspberry Pi/Arduino together with a thin client/a small and power-efficient server, which will be able to
            produce sentences based on user input. The project is still in its early stages; at the moment, I was able 
            to implement the voice recognition and the text-to-speech functionalities, and I am working on the 
            implementation of the language model, which will probably be based on a GPT open source implementation.

            This project, which I started during the first lockdown in Italy and I left aside to focus on my 
            university duties, aims to implement a plugin for MPV (one of the most famous video players for

            the user will be able to copy and paste text from the video, and search for specific words, making both
            the video to be more accessible and the learning process more efficient.
